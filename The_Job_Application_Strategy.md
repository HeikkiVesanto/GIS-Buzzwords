# THIS IS A ROUGH DRAFT AND IS NOT DONE YET

#The Job Application Strategy

Some companys may have their own job application process which you'll need to follow, but the following is what I try to do if possible. 

Applying for a job is *much* more than just handing in a resume. It's actually a 6(-ish) part process. The goal of this process is to become an attractive candidate and get an interview.

The strategy is to (1) maximize the amount of time your application is in front of the company and (2) maximize how positively the company percieves you. 

These parts may occur in any order, but may commonly happen like this: 


## 1. The email

You're going to apply by sending an email to the company. The email is the first contact they're going to have with you, so it needs to be good. 

### The subject

The subject of the email should include your name and the job description you're applying for

 > Joe Gisser's application for the GIS Developer position

You want it to be obvious that it's not spam, obvious which position it's for and obvious who is applying so the person receiving the email can quickly and easily decide what to do with it. 

Chances are, they get dozens or hundreds of emails every day and just want to file the job applications in a folder to review all at once. 

### The body

In the email you should include a short note in the body of the email. Once again, you are trying to maximize positive perception by making their job easy. The note is like a mini-cover letter. It should include: 

 * Your name again
 * The position you're applying for
 * A mention of what the attachments are (including the file name)
 * How to contact you
 * Your availibility for interviews

If any of the following will help you get an interview, you may also include any of the following: 

 * A mention about how you heard about the position
 * A mention of any previous contact with the company
 * Why you're excited about the position
 * Why you're a great applicant for the position
 * A link to a portfolio or other appropriate site

Your email message might look like this: 

 > NewCompany.com, 
 > 
 > My name is Joe Gisser and this is my application for the GIS Developer position. I 
 > heard about this position from Bob Companyman at the recent GIS Conference in Townville
 > and thought it and the company sound very compelling.
 >
 > Please find attached my cover letter, resume and portfolio (Joe_Gisser_Resume.pdf).
 > 
 > I am available for interviews any week day after 2 PM, and can be reached at (123) 123-1234
 > or at joe_gisser@example.com
 >
 > In the mean time, please feel free to check out my portfolio (http://example.com/portfolio) or my
 > LinkedIn page (http://linkedin.com/joegisser)
 >
 > I look forward to hearing from you soon!
 >
 > Sincerely,
 > Joe Gisser

### The attachment (Resume, Cover Letter and Portfolio)

Your email should include exactly one attachment. The attachment should be a PDF and should include your Cover Letter (page 1), your Resume (page 2, possibly page 3) and your Portfolio (The last page).

The attachment should have your name in it, again, to make it easy for the person hiring you to do their job.

## The application PDF

This is what the hiring person is going to read later when they print off the stack of resumes and cover letters. Page one of this PDF is going to be an AWESOME cover letter. In 2-3 paragraphs It's going to make the hiring person like you and hope that you're qualified. It's going to tell them that you are excited to work for them, and how awesome you are.

## References

If you have a really solid lead inside the company, then they're going to personally hand in your resume.

if you have a loose contact or associate inside the company or a 2nd degree connection on LinkedIn, you're going to ask your associate if you can mention that you know them when you apply. You may mention this in your cover letter, or you may add a References section to your resume.

## Portfolio

Your portfolio may be a list of webmap links, a couple pages of screenshots of desktop maps or model builder routines you've made, or something else. Depending on what you have, this may be combined with Web Links below.
