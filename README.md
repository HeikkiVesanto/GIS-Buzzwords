# GIS-Buzzwords

In college (for IT) the career counselor gave us a sheet of then-current IT buzzwords to use when making a resume. This list is meant to be the GIS version of that list. 

When making your resume you cross reference this list, the job description and your skill set to make sure you don't miss anything that would make you more attractive to the person hiring you. 

Please fork and submit pull requests with your suggestions. Feel free to include any GIS-related technologies that are /currently being sought/ by employers.
