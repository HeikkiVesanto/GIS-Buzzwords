# GIS-Buzzwords

Before I got my BS in IT, the career counselor gave us a sheet of then-current IT buzzwords to use when making a resume. This list is meant to be the GIS version of that list. 

When making your resume you can use this list, the job description and your skill to make sure you don't miss anything that would make you more attractive to the person hiring you.
