# THIS IS A ROUGH DRAFT AND IS NOT DONE YET

    Resume

Your resume is going to be 1 solid page. It's going to be full of great details, but not overflowing. It's going to be formatted nicely, everything will be spelled correctly and it's going to tell them that yes you are qualified.
In any case your references section should at least say "References available upon request" and you should have at least 2-3 people who can vouch for you. Professional references are much better than character references, and could even include people you did projects with in school if needed. Use character references only if you really need to.

    Web Links

Include a link to your personal website, LinkedIn, GitHub or other online accounts which will give a good impression of you to the hiring manager. You want to make it easy for them to spend more time on your application than on anyone else's and you want it to be positive.
